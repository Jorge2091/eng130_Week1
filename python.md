- testing the env with print statement

- Python variables?

- To store user data - hard code the data - any other type
- first_name = "Angel" - string
- name = "Subhaan"
- DOB = 99 - Int
- Uk_resident = yes or no - Boolean
- salary = 40000 - Int
- Travel = 15.4 - float
- gross_salary = salary + travel

first_name = "Jorge"
last_name = "Reyes"
salary = 50
travel = 3.3

- print("Jorge")
- print(first_name)
- print(last_name)
- print(salary)
- print(travel)

- how to find out the type of data stored in the var

- interact with users by taking user data in - input() <br/>
print("Good Morning, Please Enter your first Name")<br/>
first_name = input() # took user input & stored in the car called name<br/>
last_name = input("Now please input your last name: ")<br/>
print("Hello dear " + first_name + " " + last_name)<br/>
DOB = input("what is your date of birth in format ddmmyy:")<br/>
